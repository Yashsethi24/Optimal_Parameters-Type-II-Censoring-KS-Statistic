# Finding Optimal Parameters for Type-II Censoring Experiments: Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic
This repository contains a research project conducted at IIT Kharagpur in 2020 as part of my graduation in Mathematics. The project focused on designing Type-II censoring experiments to understand the underlying data distribution by computing percentile points for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic.

# Introduction
Type-II censoring is widely used in survival analysis and reliability testing. This project investigates the optimal parameters for Type-II censoring experiments to accurately estimate the underlying data distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is used as a tool to assess the goodness of fit, and its percentile points under Type-II censoring were computed using numerical methods.

# Objectives
- To design Type-II censoring experiments for efficient parameter estimation.
- To calculate percentile points for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic under Type-II censoring.
- To analyze the impact of censoring on the accuracy of distributional inference.

# Key Highlights:

- Studied the statistical properties of Type-II censored data.
- Developed methods to optimize experiment parameters for better inference of data distributions.
- Computed percentile points for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic under Type-II censoring using computational approaches.

# This repository includes:

- Theoretical insights into Type-II censoring and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic.
- Python/Matlab scripts to compute optimal parameters and percentile points.
- Results and visualizations obtained during the research.

# Potential Applications
- Survival analysis and reliability testing.
- Statistical quality control.
- Distributional inference in censored datasets.
